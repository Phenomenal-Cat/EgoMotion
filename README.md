# EgoMotion
Python scripts for automating virtual camera motion trajectories through 3D [Blender](https://www.blender.org) scenes.

- **Camera-motion** scripts are scene agnostic, but can optionally be linked to paths (Bezier curves) that follow specific paths relative to the scene content (e.g. obstace avoidance / collision).
- **Scene-specific** scripts are tailored to a specific example .blend file that is commercially available for download from [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/1R5o/shady-brook-in-blender). However, the scripts can potentially be adapted to work similarly with other Blender scenes, by providing relevant object names.
